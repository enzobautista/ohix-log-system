######Proposed flow:
1. ohix receives call from a department (*the employee who answers the call is logged*)
2. call is logged in system 
3. an action is taken (*resolved, service request, or request for system assistance*)
4. create required forms
5. create project once approved
6. assign employee to project
7. update project progress
8. track projects completed by employees
9. evaluate projects
